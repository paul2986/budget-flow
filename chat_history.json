Here's a breakdown of the tasks and how I envision addressing them:\n\n1.  **Remove the settings icon from the top right of the Home Screen:** This involves modifying the `HomeScreen` component (`app/index.tsx`) to remove the code responsible for rendering the settings icon. Since the settings are accessible via the bottom navigation, this change will avoid redundancy.\n2.  **Remove the quick actions from the Home Screen:** Similar to the settings icon, the `HomeScreen` component (`app/index.tsx`) needs to be updated to remove the \"quick actions\" section. This likely involves deleting or commenting out the relevant JSX code.\n3.  **Add the ability to filter by person in the Expenses screen:** This requires modifying the `ExpensesScreen` component (`app/expenses.tsx`). A filter mechanism (e.g., a dropdown or a series of buttons) needs to be added to allow the user to select a person. The displayed expenses should then be filtered based on the selected person. The existing `useBudgetData` hook will be used to access the list of people and expenses.\n4.  **Fix the add person screen, the descriptive text is not displaying properly:** This involves inspecting the `PeopleScreen` component (`app/people.tsx`) and the `EditPersonScreen` component (`app/edit-person.tsx`) to identify the cause of the text display issue. It could be a styling problem, an incorrect component, or a data-binding issue.\n5.  **Removing income sources doesn\u2019t work:** This requires debugging the `handleRemoveIncome` function in the `EditPersonScreen` component (`app/edit-person.tsx`). The function should correctly remove the income source from the person's income sources array and update the budget data using the `useBudgetData` hook.\n6.  **Tap to edit person doesn\u2019t work:** This requires debugging the `handleEditPerson` function in the `PeopleScreen` component (`app/people.tsx`).

This is definitely a frustrating user experience, and we'll address it by ensuring immediate UI feedback upon saving changes.\n\nHere's the plan to improve the app's behavior:\n\n1.  **Immediate UI Refresh:** After saving an expense (either adding or updating), the UI should immediately reflect the changes without requiring navigation away and back.\n2.  **Optimistic Updates:** Implement optimistic updates where the UI is updated *before* the data is saved to AsyncStorage. If the save fails, we'll revert the UI. This gives the perception of instant updates.\n3.  **Loading Indicators:** While the data is being saved to AsyncStorage, display a loading indicator (e.g., a spinner or a semi-transparent overlay) to provide visual feedback that the app is processing the request.\n4.  **Confirmation Messages:** Briefly display a confirmation message (e.g., \"Expense saved!\") after a successful save.\n5.  **Error Handling:** If saving to AsyncStorage fails, display an error message to the user and revert the UI to its previous state.\n\nThe primary files to modify for these changes are:\n\n*   `app/add-expense.tsx`: This is where expenses are added and edited. We'll add the optimistic updates, loading indicators, and confirmation messages here.\n*   `hooks/useBudgetData.ts`: This is where the data saving logic resides. We'll add error handling to the `saveBudgetData` function and ensure it returns a promise that can be awaited in `app/add-expense.tsx`.\n*   Potentially `app/expenses.tsx` and `app/index.tsx` if the changes aren't reflected immediately in those components.
